C# Implementation of Banker's Algorithm
This code is a C# implementation of the Banker's algorithm, which is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm designed for operating systems. The algorithm is used to determine whether or not a system is in a safe state by checking if it can allocate the required resources to each process without causing a deadlock.

The code uses the Windows Forms framework to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the user to input the necessary information, such as the number of resources and processes, the maximum and allocated resources for each process, and the available resources. Then, the user can click on the "insertionButton" to insert the data.

MainForm Class
The "MainForm" class is the first form of the GUI. The class contains several methods including:

enterButton_Click: an event handler method that is called when the "enterButton" is clicked. This method sets the number of resources and processes, creates labels and text boxes for inputting the current allocation and maximum need for each process and resource, and enables the "Available Resources calculation" button.

AvailableResourcesCalculationClick: an event handler method that is called when the "AvailableResourcesCalculation" button is clicked. This method calculates the available resources for each resource type and updates the corresponding text box on the form.

insertionButton_Click: an event handler method that is called when the "insertionButton" is clicked. This method reads the input from the text boxes, calculates the available resources, and opens a dialog window to display the remaining need for each process.

Global Class
The code defines a global class called "global" that includes several static variables:

numProcesses: an integer variable that stores the number of processes.
numResources: an integer variable that stores the number of resources.
resTotal: an integer array that stores the total number of resources of each type.
resAvailable: an integer array that stores the number of available resources of each type.
currentAllocations: a 2D integer array that stores the current allocation for each process and resource type.
maxNeed: a 2D integer array that stores the maximum need for each process and resource type.
RemainingNeed Class
The "RemainingNeed" class is another form of the GUI. The purpose of this class is to display the remaining need for each process and resource type, which is calculated based on the maximum need and current allocation for each process and resource type.

Algorithm Class
The "Algorithm" class is the last form of the GUI. The "Algorithm" class contains several methods and variables, including:

count: an integer variable initialized to zero.
visited: a Boolean array that keeps track of which processes have been checked and are safe.
work: an integer array that stores a copy of the available resources.
safeSequenceLabel: a label used to display the safe sequence of processes.
The class constructor initializes the form by creating labels and text boxes for displaying the available resources and remaining need for each process and resource type.

The nextStep_Click method is called when the "BankerAlgoButton" button is clicked. This method uses a loop to check each process to see if it is safe to allocate the requested resources. If a process is found to be safe, its index is added to the "safeSequence" array, the "visited" array is updated, and the available resources are adjusted accordingly. If a safe sequence is found, it is displayed in the "safeSequenceLabel" label. If no safe sequence is found, the "safeSequenceLabel" label displays a message indicating that the system is unsafe.
